<h2>Formatting a DECpack Disk Cartridge</h2>

<p>
With the PDP-8/E Simulator, formatting a new DECpack disk cartridge is not necessary and would increase
the size of the DECpack disk file to its maximum amount (see Technical Notes, below). With the simulator,
the Read and Read All resp. the Write and Write All commands are identical. With a hardware RK8-E, to
format a new disk, a program has to address every sector and write test patterns (containing the sector
number) with the Write All command, which writes the data and the sector header word. The sector header
word is used internally by the disk control and cannot be accessed by PDP-8 software. The Read All
command then can be used to verify the data written to the initialized sectors. The Read All command
prevents the RK8-E from reading sector header words and report header errors that will certainly exist
on an unformatted disk.
</p>

<h2>Normal Read and Write Operations</h2>

<p>
For a normal disk read or write, a program has to perform the following steps:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
	Set up the memory transfer address using DLCA.
</li>
<li>
	Set up the command register with 00xy for read and 10xy for write using DLDC (xy is determined
	by the memory field for the data transfer, the selected disk drive and the disk block number;
	see the RK8-E window for the exact bit assignment.)
</li>
<li>
	Set up the required disk address (block number) and start the I/O operation using DLAG.
</li>
<li>
	Wait until the data is transferred by &ldquo;Data Break&rdquo; (Direct Memory Access, DMA) and
	the RK8-E I/O flag is raised (using DSKP), then check for errors (using DRST to read the
	status register).
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Seek Only</h2>

<p>
The sequence for seek only (command register function bits equal three) is different from normal read
or write operation. It is necessary to put two skip or interrupt sequences in the program:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
	Set up the command register with 300x for seek only and the desired drive number.
</li>
<li>
	Load the disk address (block number) and go.
</li>
<li>
	Wait for the RK8-E I/O flag.
</li>
<li>
	Clear the RK8-E I/O flag. The drive has started to move the head to the desired track.
</li>
<li>
	If the RK8-E I/O flag is to be set when the seek is complete, bit 4 of the command register must
	be set to one. So issue a load command (DLDC) with the selected drive number in AC(10&ndash;11)
	and AC(4) = 1.
</li>
<li>
	Wait for the RK8-E I/O flag.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The alternative to the last two steps is to check the &ldquo;Head in Motion&rdquo; bit of the
RK8-E status register (bit 1) which is zero when the seek is completed.
</p>

<p>
When seek operations are started for more than one RK05 drive simultaneously (overlapped seek),
care has to be taken to determine which drive has completed its seek operation when the RK8-E I/O flag
is raised or a disk interrupt occurs. There are two methods to do this:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
	Before selecting a new drive to check its seek status, clear bit 4 of the command register
	without changing the old drive number. Then change the drive number with bit 4 of the
	command register equal to a one. When the new drive has completed the seek, there will be
	no confusion as to which drive set the RK8-E I/O flag.
</li>
<li>
	Leave bit 4 of the command register set and check bit 1 (&ldquo;Head in Motion&rdquo;) of the
	status register to determine if the now or previously selected drive set the RK8-E I/O flag.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Capacity of a DECpack Disk Cartridge</h2>

<p>
A DECpack cartridge has two surfaces, each surface has 200 (+ 3 spare) cylinders, each cylinder has
16 sectors (blocks) with 256 12-bit words. So a disk has block numbers 0&ndash;6,495 and a capacity of
1,662,976 words (nearly 2.5 MB); a PDP-8 with four RK05 drives has online access to nearly 10 MB of
mass storage.
</p>

<h2>Technical Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>
	The PDP-8/E Simulator stores DECpack disk cartridges in files with the extension .rk05.
	(For compatibility reasons, files with the file type &lsquo;RK8E&rsquo; and creator
	&lsquo;RK8E&rsquo; used by the Classic PDP-8/E Simulator are still recognized.)
	The disk is stored as an unstructured sequence of DECpack disk blocks, each block with 256 12-bit
	words. Two consecutive 12-bit words aaaaaaaaAAAA BBBBbbbbbbbb are stored in three consecutive bytes
	aaaaaaaa AAAABBBB bbbbbbbb (MSB at the left in both cases).
</li>
<li>
	Cylinders of newly created DECpack disk files are not stored in the file until a block of the
	cylinder is read or written by the PDP-8. Reading never written data returns zeros. The simulator
	always buffers a complete DECpack disk cylinder in memory.
</li>
<li>
	The RK8-E uses threads for each RK05 drive, so the drives really work parallel to the simulated PDP-8.
</li>
<li>
	The header words of the sectors are not simulated explicitly. They are assumed to be always correct.
	It is impossible for PDP-8 software to access this word temporarily stored in the CRC register
	with the DMAN IOT.
</li>
<li>
	The block CRC words are not stored in the DECpack disk file because there is no danger of single
	bit errors with the simulated disks. The CRC is calculated when a block is read or written and is
	available for the PDP-8 via the DMAN IOT. However, the PDP-8 can write wrong CRCs to the disk by
	issuing DMAN instructions shifting the CRC register while an I/O operation is in progress. Then
	the PDP-8 can read the block back and check for CRC errors. For this purpose, the simulator holds
	a bit for every block indicating that the CRC of the block was willfully destroyed. This bit array
	is not stored with the disk image, so CRC errors disappear by unmounting and remounting a DECpack
	disk or by restarting the simulator.
</li>
</ul>

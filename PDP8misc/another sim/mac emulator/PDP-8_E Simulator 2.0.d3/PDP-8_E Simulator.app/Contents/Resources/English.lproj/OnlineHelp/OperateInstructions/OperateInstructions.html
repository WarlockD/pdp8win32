<h1>Operate Instructions</h1>

<p>
The operate instructions allow a program to manipulate or test the
data located in AC and the L flag. Many different instructions are
possible with one operation code because the operand bits are not
needed to specify an address as they are in a MRI and can be used
to specify different instructions. Combining more than one operation
in an OPR instruction by setting more than one operation bit is
called <em>Microprogramming</em>. The instructions that can be
combined in one OPR &mdash; called <em>Microoperations</em> &mdash;
are executed in a defined order: they have a Sequence Number
between one and four, and they are executed in the order of their
sequence numbers. The operate instructions are separated in two
groups: Group 1, which contains manipulation instructions,
and Group 2, which is primarily concerned with testing operations.

<h3>Remarks</h3>

<ul>
<li>
	The byte swap operation BSW is not available on earlier
	PDP-8 models (PDP-8, PDP-8/S, PDP-8/I, PDP-8/L).
</li>
<li>
	The combination of IAC with rotate microoperations is not
	allowed on the original PDP-8 and the PDP-8/S.
</li>
<li>
	The combination of CMA with rotate microoperations is not
	allowed on the PDP-8/S.
</li>
<li>
	The meaningless combination of the RAR and RAL
	microoperation have special effects on the different PDP-8
	models which allow a program to determine the model it is
	running on. On the original PDP-8, combinations of RAR and
	RAL or RTR and RTL have unpredictable results. On the
	PDP-8/I and PDP-8/L, they produce the logical AND of the
	expected results from each of the combined shifts. On the
	PDP-8/E, /F, and /M, the combination of RAR and RAL produces
	the logical AND of AC with the opcode, and the combination
	of RTR and RTL does an effective address computation loading
	the five high bits of AC with the current page and the lower
	bits of AC with lower seven bits (page address) of the OPR
	instruction. On the PDP-8/A, combination of RAR and RAL
	produces the logical AND of AC with the opcode, and the
	combination of RTR and RTL loads the next address into AC.
	In the CPU window, OPR instructions with RAR and RAL
	combinations are disassembled as &ldquo;(reserved)&rdquo;.

<h3>Remarks</h3>

<ul>
<li>
	When SMA, SZA or SNL are combined (bit 8 of the instruction
	is zero), the skip takes place if one of the conditions is
	true, i.&nbsp;e. when the logical OR of the results of the
	condition tests is true. When SPA, SNA or SZL are combined
	(bit 8 of the instruction is one), the skip takes place if
	all conditions simultaneously are true, i.&nbsp;e. when the
	logical AND of the results of the condition tests is true.
</li>
<li>
	For Group 2 OPRs, bit 11 is always zero. When the group
	bit 3 and bit 11 of an OPR instruction are one, it is an
	instruction for the Extended Arithmetic Element. EAE
	microoperations are also called <em>Group 3</em>
	microoperations. 
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mnemonics for OPR instructions</h2>

<p>
Some usefull microoperation combinations have special mnemonics
recognized by PDP-8 assemblers. They and the basic OPR
instructions are listed in the following table. Note that the
CPU window disassembles combined microoperations as a sequence
of basic microoperations in the order of their sequence numbers,
i.&nbsp;e. execution order.

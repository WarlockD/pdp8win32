<h1>ASR 33 Teletype Help</h1>

<p>
The ASR 33 Teletype can operate under program control or independent of the PDP-8 unter manual
control. When operated in manual mode, characters typed at the keyboard are printed by the type
writer of the teletype. When additionally the paper tape punch is turned on, the typed
characters are punched on the papter tape, too. When a paper tape is loaded into the reader and
the reader is turned on, the teletype ignores the keyboard input and reads characters to print
or punch from the reader paper tape.
</p>

<p>
When the teletype is used in online mode, characters typed at the keyboard or read from the reader paper
tape are not printed or punched, but their ASCII value is transferred into the keyboard buffer register
KBB, from where the PDP-8 can read it into the accumulator AC. The PDP-8 then can use teletype output
IOTs to write the character to the teletype output buffer register TTO to initiate the printing or
punching of the character.
</p>

<p>
The teletypes of the PDP-8/E Simulator have the following improvements compared to hardware ASR 33
Teletypes:
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Backspace handling: When the teletype is operated in local mode, typing the backspace key causes the
last character to be removed from the output display and &mdash; when the punch is turned on &mdash;
from the punch paper tape. The Macintosh clear key (at the top left of the numeric key pad or fn-6 on
notebook keyboards) has the function of the ASR 33 rubout key.
</li>
<li>
Tabulator handling: The teletype handles the output of tabulator characters with tabulator stops at every
8th column. (Tab characters are punched to paper tapes unaltered.)
</li>
<li>
Speed: The simulated teletype can run with the speed of a hardware ASR 33 teletype (about ten characters
per second) or as fast as possible. Use the ASR 33 preference pane to change the speed of the teletype.
</li>
<li>
High bit masking for the punch: When this feature is enabled (in the ASR 33 preference pane), the paper
tape punch masks the most significant bit of the punched characters. This is useful when you run PDP-8
software that use the 8th bit as a checksum and save the output to a paper tape. When the MSB is
masked out, you can open and read the paper tape file with any Mac text editor. (When punching BIN or
RIM format paper tapes, you normally won't have to disable the MSB masking because these formats use
the 8th bit only for punching leaders or trailers, which are not needed with paper tapes stored in
files. One exception: BIN format with field settings uses values 3x0 (x=0,&hellip;,7) to signal that
the following code is to be loaded to memory field x.)
</li>
<li>
&ldquo;Copy &amp; Paste&rdquo; and &ldquo;Drag &amp; Drop&rdquo; is supported for the teletype:
When you paste text into the teletype window, the text is inserted into a typeahead buffer
from where the teletype reads it sccessively as if the characters were typed at the keyboard.
New keyboard input is appended at the end of the typeahead buffer. While the typeahead buffer is not
empty, a button &ldquo;Flush Typeahead Buffer&rdquo; appears in the toolbar of the ASR 33 window that
you can use to clear the buffer prematurely.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Console Teletype</h2>

<p>
The console teletype uses I/O address 03 for the keyboard and reader and 04 for the printer
and punch and supports the following IOTs:

<h3>Remark</h3>

<p>
Earlier PDP-8 models (PDP-8, -8/S, -8/I, -8/L) do not support the IOTs KCF (6030), KIE (6035),
TFL (6040), and TSK (6045).
</p>

<h2>Auxiliary Teletype</h2>

<p>
The PDP-8/E Simulator includes an Auxiliary Teletype that you can activate in the Finder information
window for the PDP-8/E Simulator application in the area &ldquo;Plug-ins&rdquo;. (With Mac OS X 10.6
&ldquo;Snow Leopard&rdquo;, Apple has removed the Plug-ins section from the Finder information window,
and you must open the application package manually and move the Auxiliary Teletype from the folder
&ldquo;Contents/PlugIns Disabled&rdquo; to &ldquo;Contents/PlugIns&rdquo;.)
</p>

<p>
In the CPU window,
the flags for the Auxiliary Teletype are called &ldquo;Auxiliary TTY In&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Auxiliary TTY Out&rdquo;. It uses the I/O addressed 40 for input and 41 for output and
supports the following IOTs:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
	<th>Mnemonic<br>Symbol</th>
	<th>Octal<br>Code</th>
	<th class="left">Corresponding<br>Console Teletype IOT</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>AKCF</td>
	<td>6400</td>
	<td class="left">KCF (6030)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>AKSF</td>
	<td>6401</td>
	<td class="left">KSF (6031)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>AKCC</td>
	<td>6402</td>
	<td class="left">KCC (6032)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>AKRS</td>
	<td>6404</td>
	<td class="left">KRS (6034)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>AKIE</td>
	<td>6405</td>
	<td class="left">KIE (6035)</td>

	<td>6410</td>
	<td class="left">TFL (6040)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>ATSF</td>
	<td>6411</td>
	<td class="left">TSF (6041)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>ATCF</td>
	<td>6412</td>
	<td class="left">TCF (6042)</td>

	<td>ATPC</td>
	<td>6414</td>
	<td class="left">TPC (6044)</td>

</tr>
<tr>
	<td>ATLS</td>
	<td>6416</td>
	<td class="left">TLS (6046)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Additional Teletypes</h2>

<p>
When you need additional teletypes, you can duplicate the Console or Auxiliary Teletype plugin and
then modify the property list that describes the I/O addresses and IOTs for the plugin. You find
this property list inside the plugin package at Contents/Resources/English.lproj/auxtty-io-info.plist.

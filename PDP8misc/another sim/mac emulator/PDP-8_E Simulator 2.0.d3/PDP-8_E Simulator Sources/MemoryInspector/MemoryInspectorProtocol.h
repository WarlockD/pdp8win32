/* A Memory Inspector is a subclass of NSFormatter that conforms to the MemoryInspector protocol.
   To add a new inspector, simply include a new class in a plugin; it will automatically be detected.
   The NSFormatter methods work on a NSArray of wordsPerRow 12-bit PDP-8 words. The order of the
   inspector in the popup menu of the memory inspector drawer is determined by orderInMemoryInspectorMenu;
   the built-in inspectors use numbers 10, 20,... */

<h1>KM8-E Memory Extension</h1>

<p>
The KM8-E IOTs enable programs to change the instruction and data field
registers (IF and DF) of the KM8-E Memory Extension to address up to 32K
words of memory and to operate the time sharing capabilities of the
extended PDP-8. For information about memory field addressing with the
KM8-E, see
<a href="../MemoryReferenceInstructions/MemoryReferenceInstructions.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The time sharing option of the KM8-E can be enabled with a jumper on the
board. When this jumper is in place, loading of the UF flip flop from the
UBB flip flop is inhibited. When the jumper is removed, loading of UF is
enabled. With the PDP-8/E Simulator, this jumper is emulated by a checkbox
in the PDP-8/E CPU preferences panel.

<tr>
	<td>CDF x0</td>
	<td>662x1</td>
	<td class="left">
		Change to data field x (x=0,&hellip;,7). The data field register DF 
		is loaded with the selected field number x. All subsequent memory
		requests for operands are automatically switched to that memory
		field until the field number is changed by a new CDF command or an
		interrupt occurs.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>CIF x0</td>
	<td>62x2</td>
	<td class="left">
		Prepare to change to instruction field x (x=0,&hellip;,7). The
		instruction field buffer IB is loaded with the selected field
		number x, and the interrupt inhibit flag is set. The next JMP or
		JMS insruction causes the value of IB to be loaded into IF and the
		inhibit flag to be cleared. This enables a program to continue at
		a defined location on the new instruction field and disables
		interrupts while the new field setting is pending.

	<td class="left">
		Clear the user mode I/O flag. The user mode I/O flag is set when
		the CPU executes a privileged instruction (IOT or HLT) when running
		in user mode (UF=1). Then an interrupt will occur to enable the
		operating system to handle this exception and to clear the flag
		with CINT.

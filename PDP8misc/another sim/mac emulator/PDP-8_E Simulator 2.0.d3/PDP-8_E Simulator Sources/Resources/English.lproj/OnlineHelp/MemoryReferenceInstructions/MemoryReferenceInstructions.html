<h2>Addressing Modes</h2>

<p>
When the Address Mode Bit is zero, the memory location
specified by the instruciton word contains the operand
<em>(direct addressing)</em>. When the Address Mode Bit is
one, the memory location specified by the instruction word
contains the address of the operand
<em>(indirect addressing)</em>. In symbolic notation,
indirect addressing is indicated by the letter &ldquo;I&rdquo;
between the mnemonic and the actual address, e. g.
&ldquo;TAD I 10&rdquo;.
</p>

<h2>The Page Bit</h2>

<p>
The basic 4K core memory is (logically) partitioned into 32
pages of 128 (octal 200) words each. A page number determines
the five most significant bits of an address. When the Page
Bit of a MRI is zero, the operand is taken from memory page
zero. When the Page Bit is one, the page number of the operand
is the number of the page where the instruction resides,
i.&nbsp;e. the five MSBs of the operand address are identical
to the five MSBs of the instruction words address. The offset
inside the designated page is taken from the Page Address part
(bits 5&ndash;11) of the instruction word.
</p>

<h2>Autoindexing Memory Locations</h2>

<p>
Memory locations 0010&ndash;0017 (of all memory fields,
i.&nbsp;e. locations 00010&ndash;00017, 10010&ndash;10017,
20010&ndash;20017, &hellip;) are special registers which are
automatically incremented when they are used as pointer
addresses of indirectly addressed memory reference
instructions. The increment takes place <em>before</em> the
value is used as indirect address. When these locations are
addressed directly, they behave as any other memory location.
</p>

<p>
Note that the CPU window displays disassembled instructions
as if the increment of autoindexing memory locations has
already occured; showing the location the instruction will
really access. The autoindexing addresses appear underlined
in the CPU window.
</p>

<h2>Memory Reference Instructions with the KM8-E Memory Extension</h2>

<p>
When the PDP-8 has a KM8-E Memory Extension, it can have up to
32K words of core memory, partitioned in eight 4K fields. The
value of the KM8-E register IF (Instruction Field) is used as
a 3-bit extension of the PC. IF not only determines the
memory field where the next instruction is to be taken from,
but also the field where directly addressed operands and the
pointer addresses of indirectly addressed operands are to be
taken from. The final operand of the indirect addressing is
taken from the memory field designated by the KM8-E register
DF (Data Field).

<h1>Interrupt Control</h1>

<p>
On the PDP-8, an interrupt can occur when the interrupt enable flag is set and
the delay and inhibit flags are cleared. With the PDP-8/E (not with earlier
models), any I/O device has an interrupt enable flag. They and the I/O flags of
the devices are collected in the interrupt enable and I/O flags table of the CPU
window. When a devices interrupt mask flag is set, this device can cause an
interrupt by setting its I/O flag when completing an I/O operation to signal that
it is ready for new I/O operations or that new input is available. The interrupt
mask flags can be set or cleared by device specific IOTs.
</p>

<p>
When the CPU accepts an interrupt, i.&nbsp;e. when the interrupt enable flag is set,
the delay and inhibit flags are cleared and a device thats interrupt mask flag is set
raises its I/O flag, the following happens: The CPU completes the execution of the
instruction in progress and acknowledges the interrupt. The interrupt enable flag
is cleared, i.&nbsp;e. no further interrupts can occur, the content of PC is saved in
memory location 0 (on field 0), and PC is set to one. So execution continues at
location 1 where the interrupt service routine must reside. When the PDP-8 has
a KM8-E Memory Extension, additionally the values of DF, IF and UB are saved
in the 7-bit register SF (UB in SF(0), IF in SF(1&ndash;3), and DF in SF(4&ndash;6)),
and DF, IF, IB, UB, and UF are cleared, i.&nbsp;e. the CPU switches to memory field 0
and to system mode (UF=0).
</p>

<p>
When the interrupt service routine has serviced the I/O request, it must enable
interrupts and return to the user program. (Eventually it has to restore DF, IF, and UF;
for that and the function of the inhibit flag see the KM8-E help.) To re-enable
interrupts, it executes an ION instruction which sets the interrupt enable and delay
flag, and a JMP I 0. Because the delay flag is set, no interrupt can occur between the
ION and JMP instruction which would destroy the return address in location 0. The
delay flag is cleared in any instruction cycle after checking for interrupts and
before execution of the instruction; so new interrupts can occur after execution of
the JMP instruction.
</p>

<p>
The machine instructions for controlling the interrupt facility are IOTs with
I/O address 0:

<h3>Remark</h3>

<p>
Earlier PDP-8 models (PDP-8, -8/S, -8/I, -8/L) do not support IOTs SKON (6000) and
SRQ, GTF, RTF, SGF, CAF (6003&ndash;6007).

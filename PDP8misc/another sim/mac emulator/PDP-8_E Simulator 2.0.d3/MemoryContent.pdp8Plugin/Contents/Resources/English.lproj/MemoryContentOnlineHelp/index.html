<h1>Memory Content Plugin for the PDP-8/E Simulator</h1>

<p>
The Memory Content Plugin provides a window that shows the content of the PDP-8/E memory while the
machine is running.
</p>

<p>
Each 12-bit word is represented by a pixel. A black pixel is 0, a white pixel is 7777,
other values are taken as a RGB value with 4 bits for each color: 7400 is red, 0360 is green, 0017 is blue.
</p>

<p>
Each vertical block in the window represents a 4K memory field beginning with field 0 at the left.
Each memory page of 128 words is a vertical line with the start address at the top of the line.
Page 0 is the most left line in each memory field block.
So the PDP-8/E address 00000 is at the top left of the windows, address 77777 is at the bottom right.
</p>

<p>
<a href="colorfun.pa" target="_top">COLORFUN.PA</a> is a little demo program that displays
beautiful colors in the Memory Content Plugin windows.

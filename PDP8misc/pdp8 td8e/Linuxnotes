Subject: my pdp8e install instructions for linux
To: jones@cs.uiowa.edu

I use Red Hat 6.0 with a KDE desktop, and after a bit of tinkering, I
got your Xwindows pdp8e emulator running.  I though I'd pass along my
instructions for other people with a similar set-up to use.  If you already
have this somewhere, just disregard this message.

I wrote this for people with basic linux/unix knowledge, so don't be offended
by over explination.

*****************************************************************************
Compiling and Running the Xwindows pdd8e Emulator on a linux System
*****************************************************************************
Red Hat 6.0
*************
Parts of this explination are taken from the README file included with the
source code.

 Get the source...
*******************
go to 
 http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/
and get the file "ftp://ftp.cs.uiowa.edu/pub/jones/pdp8/emulator.txt.Z"
it is the first one that reads "A UNIX based PDP-8 emulator"

Uncompress It...
******************
now, once you get to emulator.txt by uncompressing the file that you
downloaded, make a temp file in your current directory, cd to that new file,
type --->  sh < ../emulator.txt

then you have all the files you need in that temp directory.

Tweak It...
***********
add as first line of stdio.h (already on system, probably in /usr/include/)
 #define TERMIOS
save it and close it.

line 115 of cr8f.c, in the new temp directory, (in function end_of_cards)
reads...  
 if feof(reader_stream) {
it should read...
         if (feof(reader_stream)) {
save it and close it.

near the top of ttyaccess.c, change this...
 #ifdef TERMIOS
 #include <termios.h>
 #else
 #include <sgtty.h>
 #endif
to this...
 #include <termios.h>
 #include <sgtty.h>
save it and close it.

in Makefile, also in the new temp file...
comment out lines 58 and 59 (cpu=kk8e.o and CPU = -DKK8E)
uncomment lines 62 and 63 (cpu =      kk8e.o debug.o and CPU = -DKK8E -DDEBUG)

change line 76 from...
 conslib = -lXt -lX11
to...
 conslib = -L /usr/X11R6/lib -lXt
(in the above step, my libXt.a is in the folder /usr/X11R6/lib, so you may need
to change what follows the -L, depending on whether or not your libXt.a is in
the same place, but be sure to leave a space between -L and the path)

change lines 89 and 90 from...
 intern =      km8e.o
 INTERN = -DKM8E
to...
 intern =  
 INTERN = 
respectively, at least I didnt want to fool with that stuff

change lines 110 and 111 from...
 extern =      kl8e.o pc8e.o cr8f.o rx8e.o vc8e.o
 EXTERN = -DKL8E -DPC8E -DCR8F -DRX8E -DVC8E
to...
 extern =      
 EXTERN = 
respectively, again, didnt want to mess with that stuff

save it and close it.

Compile It...
*************
in the terminal, in the temp directory, type ---> make
you will get some warnings, but that is ok.

you should (see NOTE below if you don't) end up with a pdp8e excecutable.

Put It Where Your System Can Find It...
********************************************
put pdp8e in /usr/bin/ or /local/bin so you can use it without having to type
its filepath.

Run It...
********
get a .core file by using pal* and coremake*, say lala.core.
in lala's directory type...
 pdp8 lala.core

I could'nt get my compiles of pal and coremake to play together nicely, so I
just got the binary executible files from an ftp site that I knew had working
versions.  So I cant help you on compiling those.

 Use It...
********
!!!!!when you run it, DONT PANIC, it will be all black, just iconify (minimize)
it and then deiconify (maximize) it and there is the pdp8e, in all its glory...

(the following my or may not occure on your system)
to exit the program, click the exit button on the pdp8, not the upper right x
of your window or it will freeze your terminal (not your system) and you will
have to open anoher.

NOTE for people who had a problem with Xt: you will need to install Xt widgets
library if you can't find libXt.a anywhere on your system, it usually comes in
a larger package called XFree86-devel, and you can get it from the red hat
site, or other linux download places.
